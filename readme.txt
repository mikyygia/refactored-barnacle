6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I did not.

7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
IOS


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A user can simply click "log overnightsleep data" and it'll add the date + time right now or a user can manually enter in details.
I chose this because it allows for ease of use and a bit of customization.

9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Same way for the logging sleepiiness data as the overnightsleep data. But I added a feature where the user can add a note to their log.
I added this because it's a nice way to keep track of what may have influeneced your sleepiness.

10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
They're tabs at the bottom which a user can switch to. All the viewed data is locaed at the History tab. I like all of my data in one 
place.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I chose to do both.

12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
The user can set a reminder by choosing dates from a calendar prompt and choosing a time.

13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
Ionic storage.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
It's clear what is a button, heading, subtitle, and it folllws a consistent style throughout.
